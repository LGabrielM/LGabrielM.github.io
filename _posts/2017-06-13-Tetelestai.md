ΤεΤέλεσται = Tetelestai = It is finished

I don't think I will ever say these words. Not because I can't, but because I will never satisfy my Good Will. It will always push me forwards, farther than I may even expect. People that *Aude esse magni* are always a work in progress. They might be doing well, doing great, achieving every objective, yet humanity is bound to a "freedom of self." Some may refer to this freedom as "Imperfection" because of our own humanity. Yet, I have a clear argument for why that is not true, but that our "Imperfection" is, instead, a *"Freedom of Self"*: 

Statement: Perfection can never be achieved by humans.

1. Perfection is a state in which a thing is the most effective possible in achieving its purpose.  
	- Thing is anything that exists. Existence precedes anything (what makes "a thing" thing is existence) 
	- Purpose is any previous input to a system that defines what the system ought to do. It doesn't matter what it is or why it is what it is.
2. Perfection must exist if a thing is the most effective possible in achieving its purpose.  
3. Any kind of perfection must exist, if it follows "2." 
4. Therefore, humans (which are things because they exist) can be perfect.
	- It doesn't mean that whatever a person does, it will always be perfect because *determinism*. It means that considering **every possibility** determined by **all circumstances**, if the person was the **most effective possible** in achieving its objective, this is **perfection**.
		- Furthermore, because we can't know everything (every possibility, circumstance, effectivity), we can say with confidence (based on whatever data we have) that an individual achieved **perfection** or not.
 
 Yet, any human perfection is temporary and can always be improved, because humans have cognition to process more and more data, which allows us to push ourselves forward/deeper in the spectrum of **human perfection**. That is our *Freedom of Self*.
