Ethics of Invisibility


*"I am invisible, understand, simply 
because people choose not to see me."  
-Ralph Ellison*  
  

We turn to ethics in the moments when we are confronted with our darker selves.  We sense that something is wrong, whether it’s us or something out there.  Ethics is the way we strive for our better self.  It is for those who recognize their fallibility as human beings in juxtaposition to a world that is continuously expanding right before their eyes.  As wonderful as the world is, it brings also with it the problem of misunderstanding.  With such a vast scope, there is much that often goes unattended to by our perception.  To some, this information doesn’t even exist.  They simply say that what they know is all there is to know and the rest is nonsense.  They tend to live in a dream-like world as a result of it.  There is often talk in certain writings about dreams, but do not be mistaken.  The dreams they speak of are not peaceful ones.  They are ones built on willful ignorance and invisibility.  Ralph Ellison, who brilliantly describes the phenomenon of invisibility in *The Invisible Man*, puts to words what people know solely from experience.  To him, invisibility is the result of people’s refusal to see him.  To the dreamer, the mere recognition of his existence turns the dream into “a nightmare which the sleeper tries with all his strength to destroy”.  Yet, no matter how invisible they are the subjects are still very much real.  They have a consciousness.  To deprive people of such is the cruel nature of our world, but it doesn’t have to be.  Being human doesn’t necessitate complete blindness.

Typically when we speak of ethics we turn to Aristotle, Kant, Mill, even the Buddha.  Each with their own conception of how we should act in the world we inhabit.  Even with different responses, there is still a shared understanding of the components that are taken into account when forming their ethical decisions.  Actions and intentions, it is from these two spheres that our individual conceptions of ethics are derived.  In-between the right actions and the right intentions is the ethical viewpoint we should be aiming for.  To most though, this in-between viewpoint is half-dark, half invisible.  Only half is light.  Only half is visible.  
  
The dark area in this conception is a result of intentional blindness, misunderstandings, and outside forces.  If the reason is *intentional blindness* then there is little that can be said to lighten this area if the person is unwilling to take a second look.  However if they are willing or if they are just ignorant not all is lost.  It still might be possible to lighten this area for them.  Intentional blindness is certainly one of our greatest monsters, but it is not an uncommon one.  We are all capable of intentional blindness.  In fact we all at some point or another shut eyes as tight as we can.  If there is any innocence in it, it comes from already having some knowledge of the world- particularly of the bad.  In these moments it is understandable why they want to pretend that the world isn’t as terrible as it can be, but it cannot be acceptable to close them forever.  If they do not reopen, then the person is accepting those evils they fear so greatly.  They have essentially given up.  The worst kind of intentional blindness though is reserved for those who simply do not care.  They know the world can be a truly awful place, but they have resigned themselves to think that's how the world should be.  Only if their utopia is threatened would they be willing to acknowledge the existence of others.  
 
If you go a few shades lighter than intentional blindness, you’ll eventually arrive at *misunderstandings*.  Whereas the former willfully choose ignorance, this shade does so unintentionally.  In this sense misunderstandings are much easier to forgive.  Since as humans it is impossible to know everything.  At some point we will have to confront a situation in which our ignorance leads us to a mistake.  It is when we are aware of our mistake does an ethical choice need to be made.  Do we ignore or do we change?  If the answer is the former they fall back as few shades into intentional blindness.  However, if it's the later with a change in actions and an acknowledgment of their wrongs, then they can arrive at a lighter shade.  

Farther down this color spectrum- its darkest shade- is reserved for *outside forces*.  To the good hearted, they are the monsters hiding in their closet.  To the ill-willed, they are the saving grace that lets them off the hook.  Outside forces are forces that are-to a degree-outside of our control.  This lack of control is precisely why outside forces can create potential problems for our ethical systems.  For instance, power can be considered an action that is something apart from an individual.  When a person enters a group they bring along with them things that cannot easily be removed.  An example would be carrying your nationality with you when you travel abroad- especially if you’re from a dominant superpower like the U.S..  Another instance is our unconscious part of our intentions.  For example, implicit bias is something that people generally learn to have as they grow older.  It makes it understandable, but not acceptable.  Like with all types of conditioning, it should be possible to curb or at least minimize these biases.  

Of course we are still human so we will fail at this sometimes.  Things go wrong every now and then.  That is just how the world is.  When one wrong disappears another one appears.  The problem, however, is that people lack the humility about their intentions and ignore the resulting impacts that occur.  They don’t have the will to admit their own fallibility and as a result they hurt others in the process.  Having good intentions will not necessarily lead to good actions.  This is where most people get caught up.  They are capable of caring and having good intentions.  People already have somewhat of an understanding of what’s wrong and how much pain results from such evils.  It petrifies them to think that they could be apart of such things.  Yet, they must get past this fear.  To address the problem of invisibility, we need to start with *humility*, then widen our *perception*, and finally look for *actions* that will produce a positive impact.  

*Humility* isn’t arrived at easily.  Often, it’s the result of being knocked down a few pegs.  Uncertain of everything, except that of your own uncertainty.  It’s a human response we throw away after a certain age.  In a Hobbes-like fashion, we think the world will confirm to our reality.  If you bury yourself deep enough you can go on thinking like this for quite a while.  Unfortunately, life will not conform to your depiction of it.  Part of being humble, lies in a critical reflection of our personal selves.  This is crucial when dealing with invisibility.   We must undergo an existential examination.  First, we should take an honest look at our intentions.  Knowing yourself -or lack thereof- can lead to greater understanding.   Secondly, we need to examine our vices and virtues.  If we are looking for some sense of good, we must have a firm understanding of our bad.  Continual practice of our vices is what will leads us to virtue.  Being humble is something that will come naturally the more you are capable of understanding yourself and the world.  

Once you’ve gotten a grasp of yourself, it is time to widen your *perception* to larger view.  Of course this is difficult to do, but not impossible.  One way to start is to increase your current understanding through reading.  People have dedicated their lives to expanding the current literature of their perspective fields of study.  It should only be reasonable to take advantage of this knowledge.  Gaining different perspectives from sociology, to philosophy, to biology, to economics, and beyond will make ideas fit together more comfortably.  A second approach is to gain insight through dialogue.  Direct contact with other people is an extraordinary gift that we must make use of.  What one person fails to see, another person might not.  They can help fill in what is invisible to the rest of us.  Thirdly, we can try to directly experience different situations that we normally wouldn’t find ourselves in.  Whether it be volunteering or simply a change of daily life, new experiences will open us to a different ways of thinking.  Reframing our perception is meant to enlighten us to our connection to the rest of the world and to each other.  

When their is less darkness surrounding our minds and our eyes will we be able to *act* more efficiently.  Hopefully, in a way that brings together both the right intentions and right actions.  It must be our goal to act with the purpose of achieving a perfect ideal.  In this process of constantly struggling to bring out a better future will we also be able to achieve some semblance of good.
